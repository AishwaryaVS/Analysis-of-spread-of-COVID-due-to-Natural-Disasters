    <h2 class="w3-wide">Understanding the Impact of Natural Disasters on COVID-19</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">The objective of this project is to utilize epidemiological,
clinical, and geographic data from two natural disaster case studies
from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (2020-2022) to
determine whether natural disasters affected the pandemic’s spread in affected regions. We also intend to determine whether the evacuation of residents from affected regions impacted COVID-19’s
spread in neighboring regions.</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Conclusion: From the results of our statistical testing, we see that our hypthesis
holds true. Natural disasters do have an impact on the spread of
the Covid-19 pandemic. From the initial statistical analysis using
two sampled T test we found that there was some irregularity in
the rise in number of cases in the affected states. The onset of the
natural disaster did have an affect in the rise of COVID cases in
the selected states. Due to the higher correlation of population of
states rather than the distance of states to disaster locations to their
pandemic unpredictability following natural disasters, the ARIMA
test determines that the hypothesis that a high RMSE is a certain
indicator of a natural disaster occurring in the state in question
or in a nearby state where evacuation may result in expedited
spreading of such a pandemic. In addition, further attempts at the
ARIMA test would need to account for population-density and per-
capita infections in order to control population-related variables and
minimize the influence of other non-disaster factors in a pandemic’s
changes</p>
